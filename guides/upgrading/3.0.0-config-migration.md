# Config Directory Migration (3.0.0)

## Overview

In CFWheels 3.0.0, we've made a significant change to improve the framework's structure and make it more intuitive for developers. The configuration directory has been moved from `/app/config` to `/config` at the root level of your application.

### Why This Change?

- **Better Organization**: Configuration files are now at the same level as the `/app` directory, making them easier to find and manage
- **Industry Standards**: This aligns with common conventions in modern web frameworks
- **Clearer Separation**: Application code (`/app`) is now clearly separated from configuration (`/config`)

## Breaking Change

This is a **breaking change** that requires action when upgrading to CFWheels 3.0.0. Your application will not work correctly until you complete the migration.

### What's Changed

- `/app/config/` → `/config/`
- All configuration files (settings.cfm, routes.cfm, etc.) must be moved
- All references to the old path must be updated

## Migration Methods

### Method 1: Automated Migration (Recommended)

We provide a CommandBox recipe that automates most of the migration process:

```bash
# From your application root directory
box recipe https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/develop/cli/recipes/config-migration.boxr
```

The recipe will:
1. Back up any existing `/config` directory
2. Move `/app/config` to `/config`
3. Update your `Application.cfc`
4. Scan for references to the old path
5. Create a migration log

### Method 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer to migrate manually:

1. **Move the config directory**
   ```bash
   mv app/config config
   ```

2. **Update Application.cfc**
   
   Find and replace all occurrences of:
   - `app/config/` with `config/`
   - `app\config\` with `config\`
   - `/app/config` with `/config`
   - `\app\config` with `\config`

3. **Update your code**
   
   Search your entire codebase for references to `app/config` and update them:
   ```bash
   # Find all files with references
   grep -r "app/config" app/ tests/
   ```

4. **Update any custom scripts or deployment configurations**

## Common Files to Check

Make sure to update references in:

- `Application.cfc`
- Custom initialization code
- Deployment scripts
- Documentation
- Test files
- Any hardcoded paths in your models, controllers, or views

## Verification

After migration, verify that:

1. Your application starts without errors
2. All configuration files are loaded correctly
3. Routes are working as expected
4. Database connections are established
5. All tests pass

## Rollback

If you need to rollback:

1. The automated recipe creates backups:
   - `Application.cfc.bak` - Your original Application.cfc
   - `config_backup_[timestamp]` - Any existing /config directory

2. To rollback manually:
   ```bash
   # Move config back
   mv config app/config
   
   # Restore Application.cfc from backup
   mv Application.cfc.bak Application.cfc
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

- Ensure `/config` directory exists at the root level
- Check that all `.cfm` files were moved from `/app/config`
- Verify Application.cfc has been updated

### Routes Not Working

- Confirm `/config/routes.cfm` exists
- Check for any hardcoded paths in your route definitions

### Missing Configuration

- Ensure all files from `/app/config` were moved
- Check for any custom configuration files you may have added

### Tests Failing

- Update test setup files that reference the old config path
- Check test fixtures and helpers for hardcoded paths
