# CFML Language Documentation

This section contains documentation for core CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language) concepts, syntax, and features. This is foundational knowledge that applies to all CFML frameworks including Wheels.

## Directory Structure

### [Syntax](./syntax/)
Core CFML syntax and language fundamentals:
- **Basic Syntax** - Variables, operators, basic constructs
- **CFScript vs Tags** - Modern CFScript vs traditional tag-based syntax
- **Comments** - Commenting conventions and best practices
- **Hash Escaping** - Using literal # symbols vs variable interpolation (##FF0000, #anchor)

### [Data Types](./data-types/)
CFML's built-in data types and their usage:
- **Variables** - Variable declaration, scoping, and lifecycle
- **Variable Scopes** - Understanding CFML's various scopes
- **Arrays** - Array creation, methods, and iteration
- **Strings** - String manipulation, interpolation, and functions
- **Structures** - Struct creation and manipulation
- **Numbers** - Numeric types and operations

### [Control Flow](./control-flow/)
Program flow control structures:
- **Conditionals** - if/else, switch statements, ternary operators
- **Loops** - for, while, loop structures and iteration
- **Exception Handling** - try/catch blocks and error management

### [Components](./components/)
CFML Component (CFC) fundamentals:
- **Component Basics** - Creating and using CFCs
- **Functions** - Method definition, parameters, return values
- **Properties** - Component properties and accessors

### [Database](./database/)
Database interaction with CFML:
- **Query Basics** - cfquery, queryExecute, and result handling

### [Advanced](./advanced/)
Advanced CFML concepts:
- **Closures** - Function expressions and anonymous functions

### [Best Practices](./best-practices/)
Modern CFML development patterns:
- **Modern Patterns** - Contemporary CFML coding standards and practices

## Using This Documentation

This CFML documentation is designed to provide foundational knowledge that complements the Wheels framework documentation. When working with Wheels:

1. Start here for core language concepts
2. Reference the [Wheels documentation](../wheels/) for framework-specific patterns
3. Use both together to understand how CFML constructs work within the Wheels framework
