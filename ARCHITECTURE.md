# Architecture Documentation

The comprehensive architecture documentation for Wheels has been organized into the `/docs/architecture/` directory.

## Quick Links

- **[Architecture Documentation Index](/docs/architecture/README.md)** - Start here for navigation
- **[Framework Overview](/docs/architecture/framework-overview.md)** - What is Wheels, philosophy, and roadmap
- **[Repository Architecture](/docs/architecture/repository-architecture.md)** - Repository structure and monorepo migration
- **[Development Guide](/docs/architecture/development-guide.md)** - Development workflows, testing, and CI/CD

## Why This Organization?

Moving architecture documentation to a dedicated directory provides:
- Better organization for multiple architecture documents
- Clear separation from operational files (README, LICENSE, etc.)
- Room for growth as we add more architectural documentation
- Alignment with the planned monorepo structure

## Contributing to Architecture Docs

When adding new architectural documentation, please place it in `/docs/architecture/` and update the index file there.
