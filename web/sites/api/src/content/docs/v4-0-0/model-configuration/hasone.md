## Parameters

<div class="wd-params-table">

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name` | `string` | yes | — | Gives the association a name that you refer to when working with the association (in the `include` argument to `findAll`, to name one example). |
| `modelName` | `string` | no | — | Name of associated model (usually not needed if you follow Wheels conventions because the model name will be deduced from the `name` argument). |
| `foreignKey` | `string` | no | — | Foreign key property name (usually not needed if you follow Wheels conventions since the foreign key name will be deduced from the `name` argument). |
| `joinKey` | `string` | no | — | Column name to join to if not the primary key (usually not needed if you follow Wheels conventions since the join key will be the table's primary key/keys). |
| `joinType` | `string` | no | `outer` | Use to set the join type when joining associated tables. Possible values are `inner` (for `INNER JOIN`) and `outer` (for `LEFT OUTER JOIN`). |
| `dependent` | `string` | no | `false` | Defines how to handle dependent model objects when you delete an object from this model. `delete` / `deleteAll` deletes the record(s) (`deleteAll` bypasses object instantiation). `remove` / `removeAll` sets the forein key field(s) to `NULL` (`removeAll` bypasses object instantiation). |
| `as` | `string` | no | — |  |
